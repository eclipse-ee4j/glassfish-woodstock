// On Sub Components
//
// There are many sub components used by the wizard.
// Facets will eventually be supported for many at various levels.
// For example a facet for the complete StepsPane could
// be specified and rendered as a whole. Or just the
// steps/help tabset or individual tabs may be facets.
// It's not clear on exactly how much of this flexibility
// will be useful. When this is supported it would also be useful to have
// a "WizardStepsPane" component and renderer, vs. implicit code that
// creates the pane and the WizardRenderer renders it.
//
// For example having a facet for a button seems like a good
// idea, but what does the wizard do, does it register its
// action listener as well or expect any existing action listeners
// to propagate events and how does the wizard deal with this
// situation ? Does it remove action listeners, subsitute its own
// and forward to other registered listeners ?
// The common use for providing facets for buttons will be to
// specify custom javascript for client side behavior but providing
// facets for this seems very cumbersome to the average user that
// just wants to add some simple javascript to the next button.
// These details need to be addressed.
//
// As for other subcomponents, many are reused and may not be
// offered as facets. These reused sub components are mainly for
// use in the steps list, assuming a facet is not provided for
// the list. For example the static text visual features all resuse
// a single static text component.
// However the step links are not resused.
//
// Speaking of the step links, these need some serious management.
// In general sub components that need decoding are added as
// children to the wizard and filtered out to obtain the WizardStep
// children as necessary.
// Links need to be pruned from the facet map on a regular basis
// since some may only be relevant once and then never used again.
//
// Currently the typical use of the wizard tag is to specify all
// the wizard steps in the jsp page. This is a real drag on performance
// since the tag handler is generated, it just reads in all steps whether
// or not they are needed or not. Serious pruning could be accomplished
// if branches that are not taken, are not read as children.
// It would also be beneficial to have a renderer for the WizardStep
// and not the WizardRenderer itself, but this is not as straightforward
// as it might appear. Mainly because the steps list must be drawn before
// the actual step, so there needs to be a renderer that understands
// how to render a WizardStep for use by the StepsPane and a renderer
// to render the step in the body of the wizard.

/**
 * The Wizard component manages a sequence of
 * {@link WizardStep WizardStep} components.
 * <p>
 * The component delegates to a {@link WizardModel WizardModel} instance,
 * {@link WizardModelBase WizardModelBase} by default, to control the
 * life cycle and the navigation through the sequence of
 * {@link WizardStep WizardStep} components.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code Wizard} component {@link #broadcast(FacesEvent) broadcasts}
 * {@link WizardEvent WizardEvents} to
 * {@link WizardEventListener WizardEventListeners} existing on the
 * current {@link WizardStep WizardStep} and the {@code Wizard} instance.
 * The events are then forwarded to the model based on the listener's response
 * to the event.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Wizard events</h3>
 * The following events are broadcast by the wizard. There are two events
 * that are only broadcast to the
 * {@link wizardEventListener WizardEventListener} specified
 * with the {@code eventListener} property on the {@code Wizard}
 * component:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code WizardEvent.START} is broadcast once, when the
 * wizard is first rendered during a wizard session. It is broadcast during
 * {@link #encodeBegin(FacesContext) encodeBegin} before any rendering has
 * begun.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code WizardEvent.COMPLETE} is broadcast once when the wizard
 * session has completed. It
 * is broadcast during {@link #encodeEnd(FacesContext) encodeEnd} after the
 * last response for this wizard session has been written and the wizard
 * model {@link WizardModelBase#complete complete} method has been
 * called to inform the model it will no longer be referenced during this
 * wizard session. The next time this {@code Wizard} instance conducts
 * a wizard session, the {@code WizardEvent.START} event is broadcast.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The following events may be broadcast during the INVOKE_APPLICATION phase to
 * the {@link WizardEventListener eventListener} specified by the
 * {@code eventListener} property of the {@code Wizard}
 * component and the current {@link WizardStep WizardStep} in which the
 * event has occurred, and to the wizard model.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code WizardEvent.NEXT} is broadcast when the user clicks the
 * next button.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code WizardEvent.PREVIOUS} is broadcast when the user clicks
 * the previous button.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code WizardEvent.GOTOSTEP} is broadcast when the user clicks
 * a previous step link in the step list.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code WizardEvent.HELPTAB} is broadcast when the user clicks the
 * help tab, when there is step help available.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code WizardEvent.STEPSTAB} is broadcast when the user clicks the
 * steps tab, when there is step help available.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code WizardEvent.CANCEL} is broadcast when the user clicks the
 * cancel button.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code WizardEvent.CLOSE} is broadcast when the user clicks the
 * close button of a results page.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code WizardEvent.FINISH} is broadcast when the user clicks the
 * finish button on the last page of the wizard.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When the application's {@code WizardEventListener} is invoked it may
 * return {@code true} to continue the current wizard session or
 * {@code false} to prevent the wizard from proceeding, thereby
 * remaining on the current step. If the listener returns {@code true}
 * the event is forwarded to the wizard model.
 * If the listener throws an exception the
 * {@code WizardEvent.CANCEL} event is forwarded to the wizard model
 * and the wizard will proceed to complete the wizard session
 * eventually broadcasting the {@code WizardEvent.COMPLETE} event.
