/**
 * Annotation that identifies a component event. An event is a logical entity
 * that consists typically of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>an event class or interface
 * <li>an event listener class or interface, with methods that are invoked when
 * an event occurs, and passed an instance of the event class or interface
 * <li>a component "add" method for adding event listeners
 * <li>a component "remove" method for removing event listeners
 * <li>optionally, a component "get" method for obtaining an array of all
 * registered event listeners.
 * </ul>
 * An event annotation is placed on either of the required listener add or
 * remove methods. It is preferable to annotate the "add" method.
 *
 * <p>
 * The annotation for a given event should occur only once per component. An
 * event is uniquely identified by its {@link #name}.
 *
 * <p>
 * An event may be annotated in a component class, a non-component class, or an
 * interface. It is generally a good idea to define common events once, in an
 * abstract base class or interface. Inherited event metadata may be overridden,
 * by providing an annotation on the overriding add or remove method. Annotation
 * element values from the super class will be inherited unless overridden by
 * annotation element values in the child class.
 *
 * <p>
 * If names for the listener add and remove methods are not supplied, they may
 * be generated following the standard naming conventions. For example, for an
 * event "blam", if the annotated method has a single parameter, and the method
 * name begins with the prefix "add", and the remaining portion of the name
 * equals the unqualified class name of the singleton parameter, then this
 * method is assumed to be an "add" method for an event listener, and the
 * singleton parameter type is assumed to be the event listener class. The same
 * logic is used to imply the name of the "remove" method.
 *
 * <p>
 * The name of an event may also be defaulted, if, in addition to the naming
 * conventions for listener add and remove methods, the event listener class
 * name ends with the suffix "Listener". Hence for an event listener class named
 * {@code BlamListener}, the default event name would be "blam".
 *
 * <p>
 * If all standard naming conventions are followed, a minimal event annotation
 * for the "blam" event would look like:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    &#64;Event
 *    public void addBlamListener(BlamListener blamListener) {...}
 *    public void removeBlamListener(BlamListener blamListener) {...}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the event is to be mapped to a property on the component, then the
 * listener class must define extactly one handler method, e.g.:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    public interface BlamListener {
 *        public void blamHappened(BlamEvent blamEvent);
 *    }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that since add and remove listener methods have the same signature, if
 * default naming conventions are not followed, it is necessary to provide both
 * method names explicitly, e.g.
 *
 * <pre>
 *    &#64;Event(
 *        name="blam",
 *        addListenerMethodName="insertBlamListener",
 *        removeListenerMethodName="deleteBlamListener"
 *    )
 *    public void insertBlamListener(KerBlamListener blamListener) {...}
 *    public void deleteBlamListener(KerBlamListener blamListener) {...}
 * </pre>
