/**
 * Annotation that identifies a class as being a JSF component class. The
 * annotated type must be a public, non-abstract class. A minimal component
 * annotation need contain no element values, e.g.
 * <pre>
 *    &#64;Component
 *    public class MyComponent extends UIComponent {
 *        // ....
 *    }
 * </pre> It is generally a good idea to provide, at a minimum, a suitable
 * display name and component family, e.g.
 * <pre>
 *    &#64;Component(
 *        displayName="My Component",
 *        family="org.example.Mine")
 *    public class MyComponent extends UIComponent {
 *        // ....
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The javadoc-formatted comment found with the annotated class declaration is
 * also considered part of this property's metadata. Typically, the first
 * sentence of the comment will be used as the component's default short
 * description.
 *
 * <p>
 * A component's properties should be annotated with the {@link Property},
 * annotation, and its events should be annotated with the {@link Event}
 * annotation.
